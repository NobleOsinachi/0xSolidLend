                            <h1>Solidity Learning Repo</h1>
                            <p>Welcome to my Solidity learning repository! This is where I'll be documenting my progress
                                as I learn Solidity. By using commits to track my progress, I'll be able to look back at
                                my journey and see how far I've come.</p>
                            <h2>What I Expect to Gain</h2>
                            <p>I expect to gain a deep understanding of Solidity by documenting my progress via commits.
                                By committing my code regularly, I'll be able to see how my code has evolved over time
                                and identify areas where I need to improve.</p>
                            <p>In addition to gaining technical skills, I also expect to gain a sense of accomplishment
                                and satisfaction as I make progress in my Solidity learning journey. By documenting my
                                progress and sharing it with others, I hope to inspire and motivate others who are also
                                learning Solidity.</p>
                            <h2>How to Use This Repo</h2>
                            <p>This repo is organized by topics and concepts that I'm learning. Each topic has a
                                corresponding folder, and within each folder, I'll be committing my code as I learn. You
                                can browse the commits to see how my code has evolved over time, and you can also use
                                the code as a reference or starting point for your own Solidity projects.</p>
                            <h2>Get Involved</h2>
                            <p>I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from anyone who is interested in
                                Solidity. If you see something that could be improved, please don't hesitate to create
                                an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn Solidity together!</p>
